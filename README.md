# Quiz
Create and print your quiz for your next gathering, and score points for each new question. 
## Set up
Create a database table named “_users_” with four columns. One column called “_username_” to store usernames, one column called “_password_” to store passwords, one column called “_isSignedIn_” to store sign in status and finally one column called “_score_” to store total score.
## How to use
Create a new user and sign in by clicking on “_sign in_” in the navigation bar and then clicking on “_new user_”. Thereafter, enter a username in the input field labeled “_enter username_”, a password in the input field labeled “_enter password_” and then click on the “_create user_” button.

If you already have created a user, sign in by clicking on “_sign in_” in the navigation bar and enter your username in the input filed labeled “_enter username_”, your password in the input field labeled “_enter password_” and then click on the “_sign in_” button.

Create a new quiz by uploading an image (optional), enter your question in the text area labeled “_question_”, enter your answer to the question in the text area labeled “answer” and enter the point(s) the question is worth in the input field labeled “_points_”, and then click the “_add to quiz_” button to include the question in the quiz.

Once a new question has been submitted to the quiz, one point will be added to the user’s total score.

Once you have added all your questions, print your quiz by clicking on the “_print quiz_” button that will appear after the first question has been added.

To view your total score, click on “_score_” in the navigation bar.

To sign out, click on “_sign out_” in the navigation bar.
